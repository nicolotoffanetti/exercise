The program is simple and has been set up during the last week for the purpose
of this exercise, however it is self-consistent. The different steps of the
process has been divided in classes, coherent and decoupled, the program provides
a framework for exception-handling ( a basic one ) and I added some unit-test.

The program can be run using the simple command launched from terminal: 

python main.py

unit-test:
python -m unittest test.data_pre_treatment_test

I used python 3.8.3rc1 to perfrom this exercise.
some additional packages are required to run the code:

pandas
sklearn
matplotlib
